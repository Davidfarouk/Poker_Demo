# Poker_Demo
this is a basic poker game demo. you choose the number and player and number of rounds and you will get the results. by default i set that every player will draw 
his 5 cards and his hand will be analyzed. take care if you chose hight number of players and rounds that the deck will finish (only 52 cards) if need i can reset the deck 
when it reaches 0.
